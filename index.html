    </div>
         <p> <em>Big data </em> primarily refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data" target="_blank" >data sets</a>  that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. <br> Data with many fields (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.[2] Though used sometimes loosely partly because of a lack of formal definition, the interpretation that seems to best describe Big data is the one associated with large body of information that we could not comprehend when used only in smaller amounts</p>
         <p>Big data analysis challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source. <br> Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.[4] The analysis of big data presents challenges in sampling, and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling. Thus a fourth concept, veracity, refers to the quality or insightfulness of the data. Without sufficient investment in expertise for big data veracity, then the volume and variety of data can produce costs and risks that exceed an organization's capacity to create and capture value from big data.</p>

    <p> China
        The Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP, 一体化联合作战平台) is used by the government to monitor the population, particularly Uyghurs.[104] Biometrics, including DNA samples, are gathered through a program of free physicals.[105]
        By 2020, China plans to give all its citizens a personal "social credit" score based on how they behave.[106] The Social Credit System, now being piloted in a number of Chinese cities, is considered a form of mass surveillance which uses big data analysis technology.
    <p> India
        Big data analysis was tried out for the BJP to win the 2014 Indian General Election.
        The Indian government uses numerous techniques to ascertain how the Indian electorate is responding to government action, as well as ideas for policy augmentation.
    <p> Israel 
        Personalized diabetic treatments can be created through GlucoMe's big data solution.
    <p> United Kingdom 
        Examples of uses of big data in public services:
        
    <p> Data on prescription drugs: by connecting origin, location and the time of each prescription, a research unit was able to exemplify and examine the considerable delay between the release of any given drug, and a UK-wide adaptation of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines. This suggests that new or most up-to-date drugs take some time to filter through to the general patient.
        <p></p>
        Joining up data: a local authority blended data about services, such as road gritting rotas, with services for people at risk, such as Meals on Wheels. The connection of data allowed the local authority to avoid any weather-related delay.
        United States
        In 2012, the Obama administration announced the Big Data Research and Development Initiative, to explore how big data could be used to address important problems faced by the government. The initiative is composed of 84 different big data programs spread across six departments.

        Big data analysis played a large role in Barack Obama's successful 2012 re-election campaign.
        The United States Federal Government owns five of the ten most powerful supercomputers in the world.
        The Utah Data Center has been constructed by the United States National Security Agency. When finished, the facility will be able to handle a large amount of information collected by the NSA over the Internet. The exact amount of storage space is unknown, but more recent sources claim it will be on the order of a few exabytes.This has posed security concerns regarding the anonymity of the data collected.
